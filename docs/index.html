I'm thinking of having a workshop next Greer Programmers: "Binary Representation: UTF-8 Edition"
 - <a href="voltSwitch.html">Unsigned "Voltimeter"</a> discovery exercise.
 - Hex worksheet
 - Decoding and Encoding ASCII by hand (exercise)
 - Decoding and Encoding multi-byte UTF-8 by hand (exercise)
 - UTF-8 Overbyte encoding
 - Unicode Combining Diacritical marks
 - Unicode Duplicate (and equivalent) Characters
 - Using xxd
